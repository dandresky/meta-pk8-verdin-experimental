The following modifications are made in the context of the tdx-reference-minimal image.

## <span style="color:orange">Unblocking Bluetooth</span>

The issue is that after a fresh install, bluetooth is not operational. Running the **rfkill list** command reveals that wlan and bluetooth are both "soft blocked". I can manually unblock and then reboot the machine to get bluetooth working but that is not ideal so I need to fix this in the yocto build.

Checking the status of the bluetooth service reveals a potential problem:

```
$ systemctl status bluetooth
...
verdin-imx8mp-07331488 systemd[706]: ConfigurationDirectory 'bluetooth' already exists but the mode is different. (File system: 755 ConfigurationDirectoryMode: 555)
...
```

In the **/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service** file, I changed ConfigurationDirectoryMode from 555 to 755. This reconciles the /etc/bluetooth directory created by bluez with mode 0755 with the service unit's key-value setting of 0555. While the warning message went away, bluetooth is still blocked.
